            Wikipedia's crowd-sourced model raises concerns about article quality, leading to a grading system by WikiProjects 
            to assess content. Various projects have aimed to predict these grades using machine learning. This project explored 
            a new approach with the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and metadata analysis, conducting five experiments. The model 
            achieved 47.92% accuracy and 78.13% within-one-grade accuracy, demonstrating promising predictive potential.`
